This is updated code for youtube ios swift game tutorial made by Brian Advent. 

Link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpIoHPUyu8s.
Majority and base of the code belongs to Brian Advent. I only made some code fixes, because Apple made some changes in Swift and his code does throw some errors and does not build.
When i made some changes, i mention that in comments.
Have fun. Brian Advent does a great job and his teaching style is relax, easy to listen and easy to follow.
